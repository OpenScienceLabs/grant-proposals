# Proposal for Python Software Foundation: makim

Makim represents a approach to managing targets and dependencies in Python 
projects. Unlike traditional methods reliant on Makefiles, Makim 
utilizes YAML configuration, offering a streamlined and user-friendly solution.

At its essence, Makim simplifies project initialization by providing a 
versatile tool for generating projects from templates. These templates serve as 
standardized yet customizable frameworks, ensuring consistency while 
accommodating individual preferences. Particularly advantageous for developers 
in the scientific Python community, Makim significantly reduces setup time, 
allowing users to focus on the core aspects of their projects rather than 
grappling with initial configuration complexities.

Below are the responses to the PSF grant application form.

- Objective *:

  The primary objective of this grant proposal is to enhance the Makim project 
  addressing key areas to improve its functionality, usability, and 
  compatibility. The proposed enhancements aim to streamline the development 
  process for Python projects by reducing technical debt and expanding platform 
  support. The following objectives outline the specific goals to be achieved 
  through this grant:
      
  1. **Enhancement of Project Standards and Compatibility**:
        * Improve the Makim project's adherence to Python development standards 
        and best practices.
        * Introduce compatibility enhancements to ensure seamless integration 
        with various Python environments and tools.

  2. **Documentation and User Interface Refinement**:
        * Enhance the clarity and comprehensiveness of the Makim project 
        documentation.
        * Improve the user interface to provide a more intuitive and 
        user-friendly experience for developers.

  3. **Code Quality and Community Standards Adherence**:
        * Implement measures to enhance code quality, readability, and 
        maintainability within the Makim project codebase.
        * Ensure compliance with community standards and guidelines to foster 
        collaboration and interoperability within the Python community.

  4. **Functional Enhancements and Platform Support**:
        
        * Introduce a matrix strategy for targets psf-grant-proposal to 
        facilitate efficient testing and deployment across multiple 
        environments.
        * Expand support for Windows platforms by transitioning from sh to 
        native Windows command execution mechanisms.
        * Implement support for interactive arguments, enabling more dynamic 
        and user-friendly interaction with Makim projects.
        * Introduce support for scheduling jobs with cron, enhancing automation 
        capabilities and workflow management.

  These objectives collectively aim to elevate the Makim project's 
  capabilities, making it a more effective and accessible tool for Python 
  developers. By addressing technical debt, improving documentation, and 
  enhancing functionality, the project will contribute to the advancement of 
  Python development practices and strengthen the Python Software Foundation's 
  mission of supporting and promoting the Python programming language and its 
  community.


- Beneficiaries *:

  With the support of this grant, the project will provide opportunities for 
  skill development and community engagement, particularly for individuals 
  involved in the project's development and maintenance. The beneficiaries of 
  this grant include:

  1. **Abhijeet (Developer)**:

      Abhijeet, based in India, is the primary developer of the Makim 
      project.   As an undergraduate student pursuing a degree in Information 
      Technology, Abhijeet brings enthusiasm and fresh perspectives to the 
      project. He has previously contributed to the Makim project and will 
      continue to play a key role in its enhancement. Abhijeet will dedicate 
      approximately 90-100 hours over the duration (12 weeks) of the 
      project, actively contributing to its development and implementation.

  2. **Project Manager**:

      A dedicated project manager will oversee the coordination, scheduling, 
      and resource allocation aspects of Makim's development. Their role is 
      pivotal in ensuring smooth project execution and timely delivery of 
      milestones. He will dedicate 10 hours to the project over the duration.



  3. **Senior Developer (Review and Quality Assurance)**:

      The senior developer will focus on reviewing code contributions, 
      ensuring   adherence to project standards, and maintaining code quality. 
      Their expertise in Python development and quality assurance practices will be invaluable in upholding Makim's integrity. He will dedicate 20 hours to the project over the duration.

  3. **Mentorship and Guidance**:

      The grant will be accompanied by mentorship and guidance from Ivan 
      Ogasawara, a member of the Open Science Labs steering council. Ivan 
      brings extensive experience in community engagement and project 
      management, having served as the chair of the SciPy Latinoamerica 
      (SciPyLA) 2016 conference. His mentorship will provide valuable insights 
      and support to Abhijeet, enabling him to navigate challenges effectively 
      and drive the Makim project towards success.
