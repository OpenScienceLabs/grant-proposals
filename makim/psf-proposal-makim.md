# Proposal for Python Software Foundation: Makim

Makim is a Python-based automation tool designed for effortless project
management. It simplifies setup using YAML configuration and supports various
programming languages. With an intuitive CLI powered by Typer, users can specify
interpreters, debug code, and define dependencies seamlessly.

Catering to DevOps Engineers and Software Developers, Makim streamlines tasks
without redundancy. Its versatile language support makes automation and project
management easy. By minimizing setup complexities, Makim frees users to focus on
coding. Its goal is to enhance work efficiency and streamline workflows.

Makim supports multiple backends for executing code, enabling the use of various
programming languages within the Makim configuration file, including Python. By
default, Makim employs Xonsh - a shell language and command-line interface that
augments Python 3.6+ by integrating shell primitives from Bash and IPython, thus
offering a robust scripting environment. Compatible with key operating systems
like Linux, macOS, and Windows, Xonsh is tailored to streamline shell commands
and scripting using Python's syntax. It strives to offer a flexible interface to
accommodate users of all skill levels, from novices to experts, facilitating a
broad spectrum of daily computing activities.

- Objective \*:

  The primary objective of this grant proposal is to enhance the Makim project
  addressing key areas to improve its functionality, usability, and
  compatibility. The proposed enhancements aim to streamline the development
  process for Python projects by reducing technical debt and expanding platform
  support. The following objectives outline the specific goals to be achieved
  through this grant:

  1. **Functional Enhancements and Platform Support**:

     - Enhance the clarity and comprehensiveness of the Makim project
       documentation, adding a complete guide for the makim configuration file.
     - Introduce a matrix strategy for targets psf-grant-proposal to facilitate
       efficient testing and deployment across multiple environments.
     - Expand support for Windows platforms by transitioning from sh to native
       Windows command execution mechanisms.
     - Implement support for interactive arguments, enabling more dynamic and
       user-friendly interaction with Makim projects.
     - Introduce support for scheduling jobs with cron, enhancing automation
       capabilities and workflow management.

- Beneficiaries \*:

  With the support of this grant, the project will provide opportunities for
  skill development and community engagement, particularly for individuals
  involved in the project's development and maintenance. The beneficiaries of
  this grant include:

  1. **Developer**:

     The developer, Abhijeet, based in India, worked as an intern and remains
     committed to advancing the Makim project. Having previously contributed to
     Makim, Abhijeet aims to continue his involvement, dedicating approximately
     100-110 hours over the 12-week duration to further enhance the project's
     development and implementation.

  2. **Project Manager**:

     A dedicated project manager will oversee the coordination, scheduling, and
     resource allocation aspects of Makim's development. Their role is pivotal
     in ensuring smooth project execution and timely delivery of milestones. He
     will dedicate about 15 hours to the project over the duration.

  3. **Senior Developer (Review and Quality Assurance)**:

     The senior developer will focus on reviewing code contributions, ensuring
     adherence to project standards, and maintaining code quality. Their
     expertise in Python development and quality assurance practices will be
     invaluable in upholding Makim's integrity. He will dedicate 20 hours to the
     project over the duration.

  4. **Mentorship and Guidance**:

     Ivan Ogasawara, a key member of the Open Science Labs steering council,
     will provide mentorship for the grant. Ivan has experience in community
     engagement, project management, and served as chair for the SciPy Latin
     America 2016 conference. He is the founder of Open Science Labs,
     established in 2015, and has developed several open source Python
     libraries, including Makim. His work focuses on supporting open source
     projects and facilitating opportunities for new contributors through
     programs like the Incubator Program and Internship Program.

  5. **Fiscal Sponsor**: Makim is developed under the Open Science Labs
     Incubator Program. Consequently, funding for the Makim project is
     administratively managed through the financial manager of Open Science
     Labs, "The Global Research and Analyses for Public Health (GRAPH) Network,"
     legally represented by ASCRES. This arrangement ensures that financial
     contributions towards Makim are received and processed in compliance with a
     commitment to transparency and ethical practices. ASCRES/The GRAPH Network,
     located in Geneva, Switzerland, provides the necessary fiscal oversight,
     facilitating the project's ability to receive funds effectively and
     efficiently.
