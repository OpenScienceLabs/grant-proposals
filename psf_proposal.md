  - Grant Type *: Development work

  - Grant Title *: OSL Cookiecutter


- FAQ & Grants Program Info *: I have read and understand these pages.

- Date *: 03/13/2023

- Event’s/project’s website *: https://github.com/osl-incubator/cookiecutter-python.git

- Requested Grant Amount (USD) *: 2000

- Grant Amount Breakdown *: All the money will be used for development work. This includes maintenance of the cookiecutter.

- Budget *: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-LPboqqtHI7Q-3H0yij5ZcwYik7Os5tqu7h2bhJeqXM/edit?usp=sharing

- Objective *:

  Improve a project template (for cookiecutter or cookieninja) that implements all (as much as possible) the best practices recommended by pyOpenSci, but not restricted to that, in order to offer all the current best practices approaches and tools as options, including CI, documentation, static analysis tools, etc. So anyone who wants to start a fresh project, would be able to start with a very good structure and workflow.

  Additionally, the grant would help us to update the dependencies and some configuration changes when necessary.

  This cookiecutter allows you to automate the process of creating a Python project using a template that has updated technologies that are considered the most appropriate. The options can be configured according to our needs. By implementing it in the projects we can be more organized, professional and save time, which has a positive impact on the Python community and the development of open source projects.

  We are looking for Open science labs to grow and to be known by the Python community, we have promoted some Python meetings (pycafe) online. In the OSL discord we maintain a Python group, divided by various topics of interest, and we spread Python through the various projects in incubation that use it.

- Beneficiaries *:

  In general, although we are focusing on the scientific Python community, this cookiecutter template could be used by anyone who wants to create a Python package. This template is really flexible by design to be used in any area for the creation of Python libraries and programs.

  With this grant, we plan to contract 2 people from our current group of collaborators in OSL. Yurely Camacho and Anavelyz Perez are recently graduated in statistics, they live in Merida Venezuela, and they are enthusiastic about open science and programming languages like Python. They contributed to the translation of the documentation at Spanish of the library scikit-learn.

  They will also be accompanied and mentored mainly by Ivan Ogasawara, a member of the Open Science Labs steering council. He has been chair of the SciPy Latinoamerica (SciPyLA) 2016 conference.
  He had been a maintainer of the SciPyLA community on telegram from 2016 to 2022, promoting the SciPyLA Ambassador program, assisting new chairs in the organization structure of the conferences.

- Regional Support
    The remain funding would be used to maintain the template updated and, if it is possible, add new features.

- Link to Code of Conduct *: https://opensciencelabs.org/guidelines/mentoring/en/coc/

- Percentage of Python *:
    100%

- Follow-up activities *:

    As a follow up activity, we plan to have a blog post and a webinar about all updates done via this grant.
