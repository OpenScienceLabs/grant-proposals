- Event’s/project’s website *: https://github.com/osl-incubator/scicookie

- Requested Grant Amount (USD) *: 2920

- Grant Amount Breakdown *: The money will be used for development work,
  maintenance, project management and review.

- Budget *: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WlYZVKB-9x3q2WAf0rhcCuukaEMUs7Xn-sE8BqBay-8/edit#gid=528073274

- Objective *:

  Enhance the SciCookie project template by reducing technical debt related to maintenance, dependencies and build system. Currently, this template project tool allows the user to automate the process of creating a Python project with all the necessary up-to-date technologies. Via configuration options, each user is able to establish their unique set of dependencies. With the work planned for this grant, the changes will allow an improved user experience while guaranteeing a robust project template options.

  Also at OSL we want to apply for the PyOpenSci review process, so this
  grant will be used to review all the evaluation criteria, present the
  project there and apply the suggestions from the review process. It is
  very important for us to be able to apply to PyOpenSci as it is, if
  accepted, will allow us to raise awareness of our package and thus
  contribute to the development of the Python and open source community.  


  We are looking for Open science labs to grow and to be known by the
  Python community, we have promoted some Python meetings (pycafe)
  online. In the OSL discord we maintain a Python group, divided by
  various topics of interest, and we spread Python through the various
  projects in incubation that use it.

- Beneficiaries *:

  In general, although we are focusing on the scientific Python
  community, this cookiecutter template could be used by anyone who
  wants to create a Python package.

  With this grant, we plan to contract 4 people from our current group
  of collaborators in OSL. The main two developers are Yurely Camacho and Anavelyz Perez based in Merida-Venezuela, recently graduated in statistics and they are enthusiastic about open science and programming languages like Python. They contributed to the translation of the documentation at Spanish of the library scikit-learn. Additionaly, a project manager and one Senior developer that will perform the review and quality assurance will be contracted.

  This grant will also be accompanied and mentored mainly by Ivan Ogasawara, a
  member of the Open Science Labs steering council. He has been chair of
  the SciPy Latinoamerica (SciPyLA) 2016 conference. He had been a
  maintainer of the SciPyLA community on telegram from 2016 to 2022,
  promoting the SciPyLA Ambassador program, assisting new chairs in the
  organization structure of the conferences.

- Regional Support

    The remain funding would be used to maintain the template updated.
