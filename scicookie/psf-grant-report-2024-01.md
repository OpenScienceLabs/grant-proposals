# Python Software Foundation (PSF) Grant report: SciCookie

In January 2024, the PSF approved a new grant for SciCookie. The proposal was
submitted at the end of December 2023 and is scheduled for implementation
between February and April 2024\*. During this period, we have undertaken the
following tasks:

- Documentation Improvement: Enhancing clarity, completeness, and accessibility
  for new users.
- Configuration Enhancement: Simplifying SciCookie installation and usage.
- Library Integration and Updates: Expanding functionalities through new
  libraries and tools.
- File Structure Refinement: Organizing code for improved maintenance.
- pyOpenSci Peer Review Application: Pursuing quality certification for the
  tool.\*\*

Below are the responses to the event report submitted to PSF.

- If you would like to share a quote about what the PSF grant means to your
  organization (that can be used for marketing purposes), please enter it below.

  The PSF grant has catalyzed a significant transformation of the SciCookie
  tool, enabling improvements in configuration, user customization, and overall
  maintenance.

  This impact extends beyond the tool itself to community members, enhancing
  their skills in various areas:

  - Project Management: The SciCookie project has equipped community members
    with valuable experience in project implementation and organization.

  - Problem-Solving: Participants honed their skills in systematic
    troubleshooting throughout the development process.
  - Innovative Thinking: Finding creative solutions to technical challenges has
    fostered a culture of exploring alternatives effectively.
  - Collaborative Communication: The project's collaborative nature has promoted
    open communication, encouraging participants to ask questions, share ideas,
    and propose solutions.
  - Promotion of Python: Contributing to SciCookie has deepened community
    members' knowledge of Python, potentially promoting its use in scientific
    contexts.

  Open Science Labs expresses gratitude to the PSF for their grant, which has
  significantly supported the development of SciCookie and contributed to the
  professional and technical growth of our community.

  the photos are not online please send in email. If available, please share who
  should be credited for the photos._

- May the PSF share your photos in communications or marketing materials? (For
  example, on our social media, on our blog, in our Annual Impact Report, or in
  newsletters.)

  -[] Yes

- Participants \_Talk about the participants.

  _Did anyone stand out?_

  In general, Anavelyz and Yurely were in charge of resolving the issues. Ever
  Vino was in charge of coordinating the timing and checking any blockages
  during the execution of the project, he also helped the participants with some
  of their doubts. Ivan was responsible for improving the SciCookie structure,
  which helped a lot to solve the issues, he was also in charge of reviewing and
  approving the issues.

- Participant Feedback _Did the people that attend have anything to say_ Thanks
  to PSF for the grant we received, it has allowed us to acquire new knowledge
  and in turn contribute by learning, it has given us the impetus and
  encouragement to share our knowledge and improve every day.

- Retrospective _Discuss what worked out well and what you would change for the
  next time if there is anything planned._

  We are happy and grateful to have met most of the milestones presented in the
  grant proposal. Regarding the milestone referred to "Apply to PyOpenSci" we
  have found some details that we did not take into consideration, one of them
  was that SciCookie is considered a tool and not a library (package) and we do
  not fit into its package scope either, despite this we make sure to comply
  with the quality requirements (tests, CI configuration, documentation), we
  have also initiated communications with
  [Leah Wasser](https://github.com/lwasser), CEO of pyOpenSci, who has directly
  reviewed the use of SciCookie for pyOpenSci's needs as a project template to
  recommend to its community . Based on her reviews and suggestions, SciCookie
  has been improved to meet her main expectations. Leah has also started
  creating a profile (default configuration set) specific to pyOpenSci at
  [SciCookie](https://github.com/osl-incubator/scicookie/pull/273). Due to her
  priorities and schedule, this work is still in progress. We have learned that
  it is necessary to pay special attention to milestones and do a double check
  when there are milestones that involve third parties.

- General Feedback _Anything else you want to say that didn't fit in anywhere
  else?_

[*] This time was extended because the activities required study time from the
participants.

[**] This implementation process has not been fully completed due to the fact
that this is a tool and the peer review is oriented to packages or libraries.
