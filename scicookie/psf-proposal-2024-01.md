# Proposal for Python Software Foundation: SciCookie

SciCookie, developed by Open Science Labs, is a versatile tool that generates
projects from templates, streamlining the initial setup process for developers.
A project template acts as a pre-arranged framework for new projects, providing
a standardized but customizable structure. This helps users quickly kick-start
their development with best practices, especially beneficial in, but not limited
to, the scientific Python community. By reducing setup time and ensuring
consistency, project templates like SciCookie enable developers to focus more on
unique aspects of their work rather than initial configuration.

Below are the responses to the PSF grant application form.

- Objective \*:

  Enhance the SciCookie project template by reducing technical debt related to
  maintenance, dependencies and build system. Currently, this template project
  tool allows the user to automate the process of creating a Python project with
  all the necessary up-to-date technologies. Via configuration options, each
  user is able to establish their unique set of dependencies. With the work
  planned for this grant, the changes will allow an improved user experience
  while guaranteeing a robust project template options. The following is an
  explicit list of some of the objectives that we can achieve with this grant:

  - Enhancement of Project Template Standards.
  - Documentation and User Interface Improvements.
  - Code Quality and Community Standards Compliance.

  The SciCookie Team also plans to apply for the PyOpenSci review process. This
  grant will be used to review all evaluation criteria, present the project, and
  apply suggestions from the review process. It is important to apply to
  PyOpenSci as acceptance would enable the package to gain exposure and
  contribute to the growth of the Python and open source community in an
  official way.

  The aim of this project is to foster the growth of the Open Science Labs
  community by expanding its reach and engaging with more areas of the Python
  community. The project intends to stimulate the growth of Python projects that
  adhere to open science principles by enhancing the SciCookie project template,
  ultimately contributing to the advancement of scientific research. Through
  documentation and user interface improvements, the project aims to make the
  project template more accessible and user-friendly, further encouraging
  adoption and collaboration within the community. Overall, the project seeks to
  strengthen the Python and open source community by promoting best practices
  and standards for scientific research.

- Beneficiaries \*:

  In general, although we are focusing on the scientific Python community, this
  cookiecutter template could be used by anyone who wants to create a Python
  package.

  With this grant, we plan to contract 4 people from our current group of
  collaborators in OSL. The main two developers are Yurely Camacho and Anavelyz
  Perez based in Merida-Venezuela, graduated in statistics and they are
  enthusiastic about open science and programming languages like Python. They
  have some Open Science collaborations and have contributed to the SciCookie
  project before. Each of them will have an hourly intensity of 70 hours during
  the eight weeks of the project. Additionally, a Project manager and one Senior
  Developer for Review and quality assurance, these individuals will have an
  hourly intensity of 10 and 20 hours, respectively.

  This grant will also be accompanied and mentored mainly by Ivan Ogasawara, a
  member of the Open Science Labs steering council. He has been chair of the
  SciPy Latinoamerica (SciPyLA) 2016 conference. He had been a maintainer of the
  SciPyLA community on telegram from 2016 to 2022, promoting the SciPyLA
  Ambassador program, assisting new chairs in the organization structure of the
  conferences.

- Regional Support

  The remain funding would be used to maintain the template updated.
